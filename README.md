# Android Interview Project
# Overview

Create an Android app that displays a scrollable list of images. The app will load the images
from the Pixabay Service using their API.

# Minimum Requirements
- All code must be written in Kotlin
- Display at least 20 images in a scrollable list
- For each image, also display the username and number of likes (similar to Instagram)
- Clean, readable, and “production-ready” code

# Bonus Points
- Use Dependency Injection (either manually or with any framework). Our codebase uses
Dagger 2.
- Use RxJava or Kotlin Coroutines. Our codebase uses RxJava, so it is necessary to be
proficient in it.
- Make content available in offline mode (i.e. opening the app in Airplane Mode should
display whatever the user had loaded previously).
- Support screen rotation (i.e. without needing to make extra network calls).
- Infinite scrolling/pagination
